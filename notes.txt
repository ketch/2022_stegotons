For a medium with constant density (but variable K), the leading
fast-scale-dependent term for sigma vanishes.  

I found that I needed more resolution for this kind of medium; otherwise the
solitary waves didn't separate.

In my simulations of this I used these parameters:

cells_per_layer = 80
alpha = 0.5
KA    = 1.0
KB    = 16.0
rhoA  = 1.0
rhoB  = 1.0
 
state.problem_data['a1']    = 0.02  # was 0.1

tfinal = 4000 (command line)
